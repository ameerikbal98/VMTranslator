# VMTranslator

This is complete virtual machine traslator which traslates VM code to hack assembly/machine language.

If you provide a folder containing vm files the code will generate a singly asm file containing the translated code or if you want separate asm files pleasw provide it as command argument with separate vm files.

If you provide a folder the final code will contain the sys.init code but it won't be present in the separate file.
